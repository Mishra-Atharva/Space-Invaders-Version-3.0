# Space Invaders Version 3.0
This is a Space Invaders type game that I created, there are Enemies that are falling down which the player has to shoot, the player can only move left and right.
The player has 3 lives, everytime an enemy touches the bottom of the screen the player loses a life.

This version of the space invaders has a menu screen and a game over screen as well as the use of sprites and background images and audio.
